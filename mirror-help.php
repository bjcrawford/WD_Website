      <h3>Fullscreen Mode</h3><br/>
      <br/>
          You can enter or exit fullscreen mode by tapping anywhere
          inside the frame of the mirror. Fullscreen mode allows you
          a full, unobstructed view of the mirror. Exiting fullscreen
          mode will display the action bar which contains the features
          and options available to Mirror.<br/>
      <br/>
      <h3>Snapshot Mode</h3><br/>
      <br/>
          Snapshot mode allows you to take a snapshot of the 
          mirror, including the frame and any effects you have 
          applied.<br/>
      <br/>
          You can use the snapshot button on the action bar to show 
          or hide the snapshot button from the screen. Snapshot mode 
          is enabled when the snapshot button is displayed in the 
          lower right corner of your screen.<br/>
      <br/>
          When the snapshot is taken, the image is saved to the
          Mirror Snapshots folder on your device. You can easily
          view the images with your normal Gallery app. Snapshot 
          mode can be exited by selecting the snapshot button on the 
          action bar or by entering PhotoBooth mode.<br/>
      <br/>
      <h3>PhotoBooth Mode</h3><br/>
      <br/>
          PhotoBooth mode allows you to take four separate snapshots 
          which will be combined into a photobooth style photostrip.
          You can use the photobooth button to take each photo with 
          no time limit so there is no rush to get into that perfect 
          pose. :) <br/>
      <br/>
          You can use the button on the action bar to show or hide
          the photobooth button from the screen. PhotoBooth mode is 
          enabled when the photobooth button is displayed in the 
          lower left corner of your screen.<br/>
      <br/>
          PhotoBooth mode can be exited by selecting the photobooth 
          button on the action bar or by entering Snapshot mode.
          Exiting PhotoBooth mode before completing a photo strip will 
          result in the photos taken during PhotoBooth Mode to be lost
          (Example: If you take three of the four photos needed to 
          complete a photo strip and precede to exit PhotoBooth mode, 
          those three pictures will be lost.) <br/>
      <br/>
      <h3>Pause</h3><br/>
      <br/>
          Selecting the pause button will temporarily pause the image
          on the mirror. You can also double tap anywhere on the screen
          to pause and resume the image. It's perfect for viewing yourself 
          from the side or from behind. It also works well for setting up the
          perfect picture. :) <br/>
      <br/>
      <h3>Frames</h3><br/>
      <br/>
          Selecting the frame button from the action bar will display 
          a menu containing the frames you can apply to the mirror.
          The low-light frame is for when using the mirror in 
          low-light situations. I would not recommend it for snapshots.
          ;) Frame settings are saved so your frame will appear next
          time you start the app. You can download additional frame
          packs from the Play Store by clicking the button located 
          in the frame selection dialog.<br/>
      <br/>
      <h3>Zoom</h3><br/>
      <br/>
          If zoom is supported by your camera, you can adjust the 
          zoom level on the mirror. The setting is saved and used
          next time you start the app. A message will be displayed
          if your camera does not support zoom settings.<br/>
      <br/>
      <h3>Max Brightness</h3><br/>
      <br/>
          Turning this feature on will change the brightness settings
          on your device to the maximum level while you are using 
          the mirror. When you exit, your brightness setting will
          be returned to it's original state.
      <br/>
      <h3>Exposure</h3><br/>
      <br/>
          If exposure is supported by your camera, you can adjust
          the exposure level on the mirror. The setting is saved
          and used next time you load the app. A message will be 
          displayed if your camera does not support exposure 
          settings.<br/>
      <br/>
      <h3>White Balance</h3><br/>
      <br/>
          If white balance is supported by your camera, you can 
          adjust the settings on the mirror. The setting is saved
          and used next time you load the app. A message will be 
          displayed if your camera does not support white balance 
          settings.<br/>
      <br/>
      <h3>Mirror Mode</h3><br/>
      <br/>
          By default, mirror reverses the image received by the 
          camera to give you the impression of looking into a 
          mirror. Mirror mode allows you to view the image
          exactly as its received by the camera. Snapshots 
          and PhotoBooth pictures are saved using the Mirror
          Mode selected.<br/>
      <br/>
      <h3>Themes</h3><br/>
      <br/>
          Themes allow you to select the general theme of the 
          mirror app. This changes the color of the action bar
          and all dialogs and menus. The app will automatically
          restart when a theme is changed.<br/>
      <br/>
      <h3>No Front Camera Found</h3><br/>
      <br/>
          This message appears when the app is unable to find a 
          front camera on your device. The first thing you should
          check is if your device has a front camera. I would
          recommend using google and searching for the name of your
          phone followed by "specs" (i.e, samsung galaxy nexus specs).
          Usually the top result will be from <a href="http://www.gsmarena.com">
          GSM Arena</a> which is a great site for referencing a device's 
          specifications. If you believe your device has a front camera, 
          please <a href="mailto:wckd.dev@gmail.com">contact us</a> for
          further support.<br/>
      <br/>
